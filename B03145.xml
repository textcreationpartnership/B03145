         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I have in the Sequel of the Sermon endeavoured to preſent your Ladyſhip with a compend of her gracious qualifications, and Picture of her choyce perfections, which my eyes have viewed, and memory regiſtred from frequent obſervance.

            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Reaſon</hi> is rendred in this Chapter, why he curſed, why ſo madded, why ſo exaſperated, againſt his birth-day; he is angry, but he would ſeem to have wit in his anger; to give you a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional account of his deſtiny; now the reaſon wherewith his defends and legitimates his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:174958:16"/>paſſion, he recordeth in the tenth verſe, becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>it ſhut not up the door of my Mothers womb, becauſe I died not from the womb, and gave not up the ghoſt as ſoon as I came out of the belly;</hi> ſee here, if any ſhould take up <hi>Job</hi> ſhortly, and chide him ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for acting the Satyre, and writing ſuch bitter invectives againſt his birth day, he ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth up in his own defence, pleading and apologizing moſt pithily and pathetically for himſelf, and ſaying, that he hath reaſon to rage as he doth, and cauſe to complain and brand his birth-day with a curſe, if we knew but as much as he doth: Why <hi>Job,</hi> what is the cauſe of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint? why doſt thou fret and fume on this faſhion?
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:174958:16"/>why perſiſteſt thou railing at and recriminating thy birth day? why, becauſe it ſhut not up my mothers womb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I died not from the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and this is his Apology for his paſſion; Now leſt this reaſon ſhould not abide the teſt of the judicious, leſt it ſhould not paſs the pikes of an unpartial examen, leſt it ſhould not paſs the Watch of a cenſorious world, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being bid ſtand, leſt I ſay it ſhould be found too light when it comes to be weighed in the ballance of the wiſe, whiles it might be retorted thus upon <hi>Job,</hi> Why, what if thou hadſt ſeen death as ſoon as ever thou tookeſt life? what if thou hadſt been nailed up in the coffin as ſoon as ever thou waſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:174958:17"/>rockt in the cradle? and been carried to the tomb when the Midwife took thee out of the womb? to prevent this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, he ſubjoyns a reaſon of his former reaſon, why it had been to very good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he had died from the womb, and this reaſon is the argument of my Text, becauſe then he ſhould have been at reſt; for <hi>There</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> in the grave) <hi>the weary be at reſt:</hi> importing thus much, Had my birth been blaſted, this miſery I am now in, had not been extant; had I been ſtrangled in the gate of the womb, I had not been left to the mercy of the wide and wicked world. In a word, had I died from my nativity, I had not been a man made up of miſery, I had not been a

            </p>
            <p>Thus much for the Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or Connexion of the words with the preceding diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now proceed to the Explanation of the terms that are moſt conſiderable in the Text;<note place="margin">

            <p>I will not ſtand dividing the words and ſubdividing them into unneceſſary <hi>minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula fruſtula,</hi> but break open the trunk, and ſee what trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we can ſpie at the top, at the firſt inſpection; now at one general view we may make a diſcovery</p>
            <p>Firſt, Of ſomething pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed.</p>

            <p>That this life is no other then a labyrinth of labours and troubles, like the middle

            <p>Secondly, There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> That the grave is that great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Inn for all weary travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers at laſt to lodge in, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſt their tired limbs in. <hi>There the weary be at reſt.</hi>

               <hi>O Lord;</hi> as our time is very ſhort, ſo alſo it is very ſharp, the ſorrows of our ſpirits being like unto ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous weights which will never give us any continued eaſe, till they have preſſed us into the grave; for there only we ſhall ſleep quietly, when theſe ſtormes ſhall be blown over, and theſe fetters ſhall be knockt off, and we got un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hatches of an hearſe, and entoom'd in a Sepulchre of ſilence, till the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; till then we may expect
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:174958:20"/>a <hi>tot quot</hi> of troubles, a congeries of croſſes, and a continuation of afflictive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingences; which receives light from a third text,<note place="margin">Iob. 14.1,</note>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:174958:21"/>and ſo many, that except our ſins and Gods mercies, there is not ſuch plenty of any thing in the World: thus much for Scripture Proof.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:174958:21"/>ſhall probably be forced to fight with infamie; and when he hath done with infamie, its odds but he ſhall be called to conflict with ſickneſs; and when he hath ended this skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, the next enemie he hath to encounter with is death, which will make an end of him; juſt like dayly labourers we are never out of work, till we be out of the world.</p>
            <p>If you do but run through all orders, rancks and degrees of men, you ſhall infallibly find them <hi>(hoc morbo laboran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes)</hi> faſt priſoned up in this predicament.</p>

            <p>Nay look upon Kings and Conquerours, Princes and great perſonages, who by reaſon of the height of their honours, may ſeem to be above the reach of the rod, yet troubles make tryal what mettle theſe men are made of; they have their evil things no leſs then other men; how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them have been depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and degraded in the world ſo far, till they that were not worthy to hold the baſon to them, became as good (I may ſay as great) as

            <p>Now there are four things that I would adviſe every Chriſtian to prepare and have in ſtore againſt a day of trouble.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Firſt, Prepare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme thy ſelf with f ith, the want whereof makes a man to hang the wing, and go heavily under every petty loſs and inconſiderable croſs that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:174958:29"/>befalls him; as he that goeth through a ſtrong running Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is in danger to fall and drown, by reaſon of the dizzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his brain, unleſs he fix his eyes upon the bank on the other ſide: ſo ſhall we fall into ſome impatient mood of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, or at leaſt into ſome fainting fit of diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, under our afflictions, unleſs we can by the eye of faith look farther then the affliction, and through the cloud eſpye the refreſhing rayes, and comforting beams of Gods favourable counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ready to break forth and ſhine upon us; If <hi>Peters</hi> ſaith had not faild, he had not ſunk in the Sea as he did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.30, 31. And if thou hadſt but more of faith, thou wouldſt have leſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:174958:30"/>of fear, leſs of a fretting humour, under any afflicting dolour; for faith (ſaith the Apoſtle) is the victory where, with we overcome the world.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Faith overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the world ſcouling, <hi>viz.</hi> with troubles and dangers, loſſes and diſgraces, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and impriſonments; he that beleiveth is above the worlds frowning; for faith quencheth the violence of fire, maſters the Affliction, as the Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.34. And that either by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining

            <p>By aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us
<list>
                  <item>1. That afflictions have an end.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Faith tels and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth the afflicted patient, that the time is comming, when he ſhall ſee an end of all his troubles. At laſt came that ſeaſonable ſalute to the murmering Jſraelites, The enemies that you have ſeen to day, you ſhall ſee them no more; and at laſt came that comfortable call to <hi>Noah,</hi> Go forth of the Ark; and if God think good to ſay to us,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:174958:31"/>enter into the ark, into this trouble, or that tryal, faith will perſwade us that he hath another word, <hi>viz.</hi> Come forth of the Ark, come out of priſon, come from off a ſick Bed; for the grievance thou haſt long laid under, thou ſhalt under-ly it no more; this is one way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by faith worketh the heart to a ſweet ſerene compoſure in the moſt ſuffering condition; it perſwadeth us that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have an end; Here we have no continuing City, <hi>Heb</hi> 13. therefore our afflictions cannot continue; our Lives here are but ſhort, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the life of our afflictions cannot be very long; be then content but a little and the ſcene will alter; for when the Gold is fined enough, the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:174958:32"/>furnace ſhall hold it no longer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Faith perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the poor patient, that Afflictions have not onely an end, but a good end; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Our light Affliction, which laſts but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. God will ere long turn our water into wine, the ſtorme into a calme, and our crown of thorns into a crown of glory. Firſt <hi>David</hi> held his Shepherds ſtaff, and ſhortly after his Royal Scepter; Gods children may be under a cloud, and be put to hard ſervices here, but they may acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in this, that their <hi>light afflictions which are but for a moment, work for them a far
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:174958:32"/>more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;</hi>
               <note place="margin">It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Caeſar</hi> that when he came to be Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, he gave a friend of his that was in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for his ſake, a chaine of gold, that did equaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh as much as his iron chain did; I deeed here, was a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven gold for iron, &amp; weight for weight but God exceeds <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for he gives not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for meaſure, &amp; w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th upon the happy reſult and bleſſed event thereof, and this bore up their hearts bravely in the middeſt of Martyrdoom, and very cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of their ſufferings. Oh ſirs, the frequent beleiving views of heaven, (would you but keep theſe freſh and warm upon your thoughts) would quicken and comfort your ſpirits in the day of diſtreſs; our horſes will carry us more chearfully in travel when they draw homeward, where they expect reſt; and the patient will quietly endure the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſores, and lance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wounds, when he thinks on the eaſe that will follow; All temporal ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are nothing to us, ſo far as we have a foreſight of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:174958:33"/>the eternal recompence, What made the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſo freely to take up their quarters in the fiery Region, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17.21 but becauſe they had faith to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them of deliverance? what moved <hi>Moſes</hi> to chuſe affliction with the people of God, rather then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe he was well furniſhed with faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he had reſpect to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. What animated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged <hi>Job</hi> under his ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tryals and fad preſſures, but becauſe he had faith to believe a happy event of all his troubles? <hi>viz.</hi> that when God had tryed him a while, he ſhould come out of the Furnace like Gold purified

Therefore as <hi>Abraham</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw Chriſts day and rejoyced, ſo could ye but in ſuffering times, freequently foreſee that day when Chriſt will give you reſt, you would with <hi>Paul</hi> be cheerful in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:174958:34"/>do any thing, ſuffer any thing, be any thing, every thing, while they live, that they might have ſuch benefit of and advantage by their troubles when they dye! and thus faith ſhews the ſoul the recompence and reward that ſhall be made it for all its troubles and grievances, and from thence, as from a flower, it diſtils the ſpirits and quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of divine comfort, wherewith the Chriſtian is enabled to paſs the Pilgrimage of a weariſome and afflicted life, with much interiour ſatisfaction and hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation: How ſollicitous then ſhould we all be to be well ſtored and prearmed with this ſpiritual proviſion! would ye lead comfortable lives? live up then to the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:174958:35"/>height of your faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Prearme your ſelves with patience; for now have you need of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. Now in the hour of tryal and tentation, now in the day of trouble and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the carking careful houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders will be ſure to hoard up heaps of temporal proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt a dear year; for ſay they, we know not what need we may have before we dye; let their worldly wit teach us heavenly wiſdome, even to be as vigorous, ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and provident for gr ce, as they are for goods; for we know not but we may have need hereafter of all we have, though it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into a treble proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; be injuring thy ſelf then

            <p>And for the improvement of thy Patience, learn theſe few leſſons beforehand.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Into what condition ſoever Providence ſhall caſt thee, believe it to be the beſt, and then thou wilt never be diſguiſed with diſcontent, nor metamorphoſed with a ſpirit of murmuring. <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> preferd his Tub before <hi>Alexanders Trophie,</hi> his Cyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal life, before the others Royalty; he phancyed his little Cloyſter beſt, and ſo reſted ſatisfied; ſo if we could but phancy a little eſtate, and low condition, to be beſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:174958:36"/>for us, as having fewer cares in it, and a leſs account following after it, it would be far more eligible and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting; Vain men phancy ſuch or ſuch a condition beſt; they would flaunt in their Ruffs, and flouriſh in their bravery, and have all the ſtrings of vanity ſtrike at once, and hereupon they are vexed if their wills be croſſed; But learn you to ſubſcribe your wills to Gods will, and ever think it beſt to be at his finding; God is wiſe: he knows whether food or Phyſick would be more proper to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; whether an empty cheſt or full eſtate would conſult more for your ſafety and conveniency; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do but acquieſce in his

            <p>Secondly, Value the things of the world according to their own worth; let them not be too high in thy eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation while thou haſt them, and they will prove the leſs affliction to thee when thou parteſt with them; Now the beſt verdict thou canſt paſs upon them, is that of <hi>Solomons, Eccl.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Vanity of vanity, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of vanity, all is vanity;</hi> you may call them what you pleaſe, but <hi>Solomon</hi> ſheweth what they are, <hi>viz.</hi> Vanity; you may call them pleaſant vanities, or profitable vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or honeſt vanities; but <hi>David</hi> calls them deceitful vanities, and <hi>Jonah</hi> calls them

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:174958:38"/>Husband or Wife left behind for thy comfort? haſt thou not health in thy body, or grace in thy ſoul? and are not theſe as good to thee as ten ſons? ſuppoſe thy money is gone, thy eſtate gone; but ſo long as thy breath is not gone, thy life not gone, thy God, thy Chriſt and heaven not gone, thou art no great loſer; Gods diſpenſations are ſo Checquer wrought with blacks and white, that a Chriſtian hath never ſuch cauſe to weep with one eye, but he hath as great cauſe or greater, to laugh with the other. Oh then eye not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the blacks, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give a glance at the whites; look on the light ſide of the Lanthorn, and not on the dark ſide of thy
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:174958:38"/>condition; remember thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and forget thy croſſes, and thy diſcontent will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Were we but more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Gods mercies, we ſhould be leſs afflicted with our miſeries; this is the third.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Be more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for your ſins, and you will be leſs troubled at your Afflictions; compare thy ſins with thy ſufferings, and thou wilt find the former ſo far exceed the latter, both in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, number and meaſure, that thou wilt break forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ezra's</hi> confeſſion, <hi>Lord, thou haſt puniſhed me leſs then I have deſerved.</hi> What wouldſt thou have no correction to be laid upon thy back, who haſt ſo much corruption lurking in thy heart? Wouldſt thou
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:174958:39"/>have nothing of pain adhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee, who haſt ſo much of crime inhearing in thee? Is not thy holineſs imperfect? and wouldſt thou have thy happineſs intire? do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in cold blood, what wrath, what wo thou deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and thou wilt ſoon be contented with what thou feelleſt; doth God correct thee with Scourges? he might ſcourge thee with Scorgions; doth he call for thy eſtate, and caſt thy body in priſon? he might as well take away thy life, and ſend thy ſoul to hell; doth he rob thee of thy coyne? he might if he pleaſed bereave thee of thy Chriſt too; In a word, he might Damn thee without any more adoe, as well as whip thee, and heighten thy torment in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:174958:39"/>hell, as well as leſſen thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts on earth; <hi>for the wages of ſin is death,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. Do but ſadly think of this, and this Devil of diſcontent will not dare to ſhew his head. Every Malefactor is well content with fineing, when he knows he deſerveth hanging, and thankfully acknowledgeth the mercy of the Judge therein; ſo would we, could we but make the caſe our own.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Conſider that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content doth but drive the nail deeper, and make the croſs ſit heavier. As a bird in a ſnare, by flutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get out, is yoked the harder in; or as one in Irons, by ſtrugling and ſtriving to wring them off, hurts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more then the Irons do:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:174958:40"/>thus many add to their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by their own folly, and make the burden heavier by their impatience, then ever God made it by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; their greateſt grievance ariſeing <hi>ab intra,</hi> from the diſcompoſure of the ſpirit within; not <hi>ab extra,</hi> from the preſſure of the affliction without; like unto certain ſick men, who would ever be changing their beds, yet they never find reſt, for that the cauſe of their griefe lies not in their beds, but in their bodies. I'ts their diſtemper within that makes every room they come in, every company they keep, and every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion irkſom, tedious, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable; ſo tis in this caſe, it is this Malignant va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, this peccant humour
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:174958:40"/>of diſcontent in a mansſpirit, that imbitters every accident, puts a ſting into every croſs, makes every affliction more afflictive then elſe it would be.</p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, all thy wrongs and hard uſages, all thy afflictions and loſſes, all thy injuries and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, that have, do, or ever ſhall betide thee, were deſigned and intended for thee before time, and now by the wiſe and over-ruleing Providence of God are effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and executed upon thee in time; It is not fortune or chance (in the vulgar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction) it is not men or Devils, but the Almighty Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah that afflicts us, who having abſolute power over us, may diſpoſe of us, either by poverty or plenty, by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:174958:41"/>ſickneſs or health, by life or death, as beſt pleaſeth him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this made old <hi>Eli</hi> hold his peace, when <hi>Samuel</hi> read him the ſad ſtory of his ruind poſterity; <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eli, let him do what ſeems him good;</hi> and this one thought kept on foot in our minds, <hi>viz.</hi> that its Gods own finger that tempers the cup of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction for us, may be of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power, to cool and allay any impatiency that might either riſe in our hearts, or rage in our tongues, againſt the inſtruments of our trouble; this was that which quieted <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit, and made him that he had not a word to ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9. <hi>I was dumb,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not my mouth;</hi> why ſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:174958:41"/>ſilent and quiet under the rod, that there was not one whimper, or whining look to be ſeen or heard? he tells us the reaſon, <hi>becauſe thou didſt it;</hi> becauſe God was the Author, the orderer and diſpoſer of his affliction. If the blow had come from any other hand, he could not have taken it ſo ſilently; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the hand of God who might diſpoſe of him and deal with him as he pleaſed, he contained his tongue in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and poſſeſſed his heart with patience; The like we ſee in <hi>Job,</hi> when he had the wit to premiſe, <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away;</hi> he had the grace to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>Bleſſed be the name of the Lord; Job</hi> doth not ſay, The Lord hath given, and the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:174958:42"/>
               <hi>Caldeans</hi> have taken away; the Lord hath enriched me, and Satan hath robd me; but as if he had never heard of men or Devil, of fire or wind, he layes all at Gods Threſhold, <hi>the Lord hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away;</hi> he falls not out with man or means, he is not angry with chance or fortune, with ſtars or conſtellations; he did not like a child blame the block he ſtumbled on, nor like a Country cur ſnarle and ſnatch at the ſtone thrown, never looking after the throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but he ſaw God as Juſtice of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> giving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and granting Licenſe to his Enemies to ſequeſter him, and this ſtoopt his heart into that (not onely patient, but) Panegyrical proſtration, <hi>bleſſed be the name of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:174958:42"/>Lord.</hi> A clear view and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct apprehenſion of the hand of God in any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is a Soveraigne auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to melt our wills, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer our hearts into content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under that affliction. There was provocation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the venemous tongue of vile <hi>Shimei,</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave incenſed and enraged <hi>Davids</hi> Royal heart againſt that dead dog; unkindneſs, nay cruelty enough in the flinty ſpirits of the ſtone-hearted Jews, againſt the holy Jeſus, to have forced his diſpaſſionate ſoul (if poſſible) into a fit of fury and implacable reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; The every and downright robbery enough in the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the <hi>Caldeans</hi> towards <hi>Job,</hi> to have ſtird him up (if not publickly to proſecute
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:174958:43"/>the Law, yet privately) to ſtudy revenge; but theſe pious perſons, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious practice of the point in hand, and from the ſtrength of this conſideration which I have here commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your obſervation, for the demoliſhing of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, have been converted into contentment, and melted into patience and pleaſedneſs, in deſpite of all occaſions and provocations to the contrary; for in all their afflictions they lookt beyond the creature, and pitcht upon the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> or principal Agent, God; <hi>David</hi> did not ſo much ſee <hi>Shemei</hi> curſeing, as God commiſſioning him to curſe; It may be the Lord hath bid him, ſaid he, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10. And our deareſt Lord lookt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:174958:43"/>beyond the Governours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him, the Prieſts accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, Pilates condemning him, and the mercyleſs rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Jews crucyfying him; he lookt beyond theſe, even to the hand of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, compoſeing this bitter Potion for him, and reaching it to him; You can do nothing ſaid he, but what my Father hath preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be done; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he reſolveth on it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repineing, Shall not I drink the cup which my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given me?</p>
            <p>Therefore when ever any affront is put upon thee, when any unpleaſing providence or croſs accident befalls thee, ſee ſomething of God in it, as intending it for the purgation of thy ſin, or probation of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:174958:44"/>thy ſincerity, or for ſome ſuch like end and purpoſe; ſay ſeriouſly in thy own heart, Certainly this is from God, and for my good; ſay with <hi>Eli,</hi> It is the Lord, and it will not be hard then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the ſame preſident, <hi>Let him do what ſeems him good,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. Nay not only grace but nature may teach us thus much manners; for what beaſt do we ſee though never ſo ſavage in it ſelf, which will not take blows from his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without relucting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining? and therefore that man muſt be much more bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh then his beaſt, and come a degree ſhort of a meer ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, that dares ſtruggle when his God ſtrikes, and cry when his maker corrects; O Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, when Gods hands lies
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:174958:44"/>upon thy back, do thou lay thine own hand upon thy mouth, according to <hi>Davids</hi> direction, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 46.11. Be ſtill and know that I am God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, pre-arm your ſelves with ſe f-denyal: He that will be my diſciple, ſaid Chriſt, muſt deny himſelf; if we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to have any thing to do with Chriſt, we muſt not have much to do with ſelf; he cannot profeſs Chriſt well, who cannot willingly deny himſelf for Chriſt; the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of ſelf, was the firſt ſin of Satan; and muſt firſt be caſt down in our hearts, if ever Chriſt be ſet up there; Selfiſhneſs is the very ſeed of ſin, whereby a man ſeeks to pleaſe himſelf, and to advance himſelf in his own intereſt,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:174958:45"/>according to his own wit, and his own will; ſelfiſhneſs is an enemie to ſuffering (and by conſequence to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with Chriſt) it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults for eaſe, pleaſure, and plenty: and if we humour ſelf, if we cocker the fleſh, and gratifie the luſts of it, we ſhall ſooner be Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts then Chriſts Croſs-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and ſons of pleaſures, rather then mortified Martyrs</p>
            <p>Oh then make a dayly reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thy ſelf up to Gods diſpoſal; labour to get thy will Martyred, and maſtered into a compliance with the will of God. Then nothing will come amiſs to thee, when thy ſoul by ſelf-denial is ſo ſweetly diſpoſed for a willing welcome of any tryal that can befall thee.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:174958:45"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Now to work thy heart to this ſelf-denying fraime, let me commend theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories to thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Hath not God deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed infinitely more for thee, then ever he required that thou ſhouldſt deny for him? It may be thou art called to deny thy relations, to part with a friend, or a child for his ſake? and this is thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: but hath not God free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrificed his ſon, his onely ſon to death, and that for to bring thee to eternal life? God ſo loved the world, ſaith St. <hi>John Chap.</hi> 3.16. that he gave his only ſon for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Though we be leſs then the leſt of all Gods
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:174958:46"/>mercyes, yet he thought not the beſt too good for us; for he ſo loved us, that he parted with his ſon for us; Ah ſirs, here's a <hi>ſic</hi> without a <hi>ſicut;</hi> this (ſo loved) ſpeaks the unſpeakableneſs of his love, ſo intirely, ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſo infinitely, even ſo as cannot be conceived how; So dear are children to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that the Prophet puts this Querie, <hi>Can a Mother forget her Child?</hi> yet ſuch is Gods love to us, that he ſeemed to forget his ſon, his dear ſon, his beſt belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſon, that lay in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Father, and was his delight from all eternity; yet I ſay, he ſeemed to forget this ſon, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the better to make us his ſons; he denies him that he might own us; he parteth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:174958:46"/>with him for a while, that he and we might meet for ever; and doth not this one inſtance make the duty of ſelf-denial appear rational and very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to thee?</p>
            <p>Is it thy eſtate that thou art bid deny; is it part of thy lively-hood that Providence bids thee part with, and make a reſignation of, and doth this trouble thee? but tell me, hath not the Holy Jeſus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended, and conſented to be turned out of heaven, and be diveſted of all the glory that he was poſſeſſed of there, to lead a poor, afflicted, derided and perſecuted life, amidſt his enemies on earth? did not he quit heaven and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof for thee? and wilt not thou reſigne an eſtate or a few Acres of earth for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:174958:47"/>him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> did not he open his veines and let out his blood for thee? and grudgeſt thou to open thy bags, and part with thy money for him? O baſeneſs to be bluſhed at! O remember but what thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our denied for thee; and if there be any thing of an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Chriſtian in thee, it will be a Powerful argument, to perſwade thee to deny any thing, every thing for him; and to ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know and enjoy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Chriſt, and him crucified. Look but up to the Croſs where Chriſt hung for thy ſins, and it will make thee fadge with thy Croſs the more willingly, and underlie it the more reſolvedly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To work thy heart to a ſelf-denying frame,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:174958:47"/>let me commend this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to thy conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Cannot God compenſate thee for what he calls from thee? cannot he repaire thy loſs, and crown thee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, with a reward which ſhall both in weight and worth ſuperlatively ſurpaſs all thy dammages here? will not heaven make amends for all? the Martyrs knew this well, and that made them covet to carry the Croſs, and leap into the flames, and ſing at the ſtake as they did; the Apoſtles knew this well, and that made them joy in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as they did, conſidering that through them they ſhould enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. Conſider then though you may be loſers for Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, yet you ſhall not
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:174958:48"/>be loſers by Chriſt; he will requite you either in kind or in kindneſs, here or hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; you have a Ticket under Chriſts own hand, to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine you of the truth of what I ſay, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.29. <hi>He that loſeth Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lands or Liberty, Life or Eſtate, for my ſake and the Goſpels, ſhall receive in this life an hundred fold,</hi> not in kind, but in <hi>Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> not <hi>Formaliter</hi> but <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenter;</hi> not a hundred fathers or a hundered eſtates, but he ſhall have that which is worth as much; he ſhall enjoy that in God, which all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comforts would be to him, if they were multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an hundred times, and in the world to come everlaſting life; ſo that as <hi>Haman</hi> ſaid
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:174958:48"/>in another caſe, Thus ſhall it be done to the man whom the King delighteth to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; ſo may I ſay in this caſe, Thus ſhall it be done to Chriſts Croſs-bearers, to Chriſts fellow-ſufferers: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe now Chriſtian thy God ſhould grant a commiſſion to the enemie to ſequeſter thy eſtate, to Impriſon thy perſon, to murther thy fame, and to require thy life too, can it ſeem unreaſonable to thee qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to quit them, whilſt this truth keeps freſh and fair in thy memory?</p>
            <p>Theſe are the two Queries I would leave with you; the two conſiderations I would fain faſten upon you, for the throwing down of this idol of ſelf in you: Ponder
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:174958:49"/>upon them conſiderately, and practiſe accordingly, and be ſelffiſh if thou canſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I proceed now to the laſt praticular, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme your ſelves with a good conſcience; this will be of marvellous uſe to quicken and comfort your hearts under the deepeſt diſconſolations you may meet with ere you dye. When <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have a Conſcience voyd of offence both towards God and man, he ſoon could draw this inference, I have learnt in every condition to be content: Its guilt in the Conſcience that breeds diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet in the heart; If duſt or moates get into the eye, they make it water, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:174958:49"/>cauſe a ſoreneſs in it; but if the eye be clear, all is prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Thus, if any ſin be left in any corner of thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thou mayſt expect that grief and diſquiet will follow after; but keep a clear Conſcience, and all is well: let it be firſt pure, and fear not but it will be peaceable: what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of a good ſtomack, may be ſaid of a good Conſcience, To the hungry ſoul every bitter thing is ſweet, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.7. ſo to an excuſing and acquitting conſcience, every ſower ſop of Affliction is as a ſweet bit of interiour conſolation; ſuch a one can draw comfort out of the bittereſt drug, and a health reſtoring portion out of the deadlieſt and ranckeſt poyſon; therefore
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:174958:50"/>ſaid the Apoſtles under the moſt ſmarting rods of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and impriſonment. Our rejoycing is the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, Oh keep Conſcience clear,<note place="margin">Let inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency be in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus have I done with the Firſt Inference, in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>Firſt, Something muſt be done while the rod of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lyeth upon thee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, and ſomething muſt be done when it is taken off you.</p>
            <p>The former duty brancheth it ſelf into theſe two particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You muſt turn your afflictions into prayers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you muſt turn your afflictions into tears.</p>
            <p>Firſt, You are to turn your afflictions into prayers; <hi>Call upon me,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>in the time of trouble, Pſal</hi> 50.15. and <hi>Is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:174958:52"/>any afflicted? let him pray,</hi> ſaid <hi>James, Chap.</hi> 5.13. When God is beating our backs, we ſhould be bowing our knees; when he is afflicting we ſhould fall to praying; Is any afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? let him pray; contrary to the practice of ſome, who when God is chaſtiſeing, they fall a chafeing; when God is correcting, they fall to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining; like wild bulls they grow mad by bateing? if croſſes or loſſes ruſh in upon them, and their eſtates begin to waſte, they fall to the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> language, <hi>viz.</hi> Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repining, and like the Sea in a ſtorme, they foam out their own ſhame, and caſt up the mire and dirt of their muttering and male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſpirits; but Chriſtians are to make another uſe of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:174958:52"/>their afflictions; for when God frowns, they ſhould beg moſt for his ſmiles; and when he turns his back, they ſhould ſue hardeſt for his face and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing countenance to ſhine upon them: never had <hi>David</hi> penned ſo many Pſalmes, nor put up ſo many pathetick prayers to God, had not the drawing plaiſters of affliction ſuckt them from him; Never had <hi>Daniel</hi> perſiſted panting in his prayers as he did, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 9.19.) <hi>O Lord hear, O Lord forgive, O Lord hearken and do: O Lord defer not for thy names ſake,</hi> had not the eſoud of the divine diſpleaſure hung over the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which threatened it with ſome ſweeping judgment, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.17. O what fluent prayers ſhould iſſue from us, and what

They poured out a prayer, ſaid the Prophet, when thy chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings were upon them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our prayers did but drop out before, now they ſhould be poured out; whereas they ebbed at other times, they ſhould now flow.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You are to turn your afflictions into tears, tears of a penitential Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cordial contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſorrowing in ſecret for the baſeneſs of your natures, and badneſs of your lives, whereby you have dared God to draw his ſword, to bend his bow, and ſhoot his darts of diſpleaſure at you; ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times ſhould be ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:174958:53"/>and repenting times, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to joyne with lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant reſolution, Let us ſearch and try our ways, and turn to the Lord our God. When the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> the Devil and the <hi>Sabeans</hi> were ſcratching and ſcrambling for <hi>Jobs</hi> Cattle, and making a gap in his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate, then was <hi>Job</hi> a ſearching his heart, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for his ſins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing his repentance, and repairing the breaches in his ſpiritual eſtate; for ſaith the Text, <hi>then Job fell down and worſhipped, Job.</hi> 1.20 When the good man was informed of thoſe ſoul-ſadding caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that had ſurpriſed him, how that all the creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts he had in the whole world, were dead and buryed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:174958:54"/>in ſilence, and forgetfulneſs, hereupon he <hi>rent his mantle, ſhaved his head, fell down and worſhipped;</hi> loe <hi>Jobs</hi> carriage under his affliction; when Satan urgeth him to rend Gods name with reproach and curſing, he rends his heart and habit; when he tempts him to ſtand up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God, <hi>Job</hi> on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry falls down and worſhips God; when afflictions ſend us home to God, like ſo many penitent prodigals, with melting eyes, and mourning hearts, for our unhandſome behaviour, and unkind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour towards him, then have they a ſweet influence and bleſſed operation upon us, and are to us what God intended them, <hi>viz.</hi> Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives to Repentance, and

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:174958:76"/>up then thou Child of God; what though thou ſhouldeſt lye at the mercy of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting enemie? what though the day of peace, plenty and proſperity ſhould begin to thicken, darken, and grow cloudy, and on the ſudden ſome Whirle-wind of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſhould threaten thee with inevitable ruin? cannot the Almighty ſtill the noyſe of theſe waves, and whiſtle back the winds into their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries; or carry thee out of the ſtorme, by conveying thee into the Sanctuary of a Sepulchre, and ſecurity of a grave? where thou ſhalt be as a man unconcerned in the tragedie. What though <hi>Mordecai</hi> lay a while at the gate, and <hi>Mary</hi> ſit a while under the Table, and what
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:174958:76"/>if you underlie a little the chaſtenning hand of God? yet in all your inevitable ſtraits, do ye in all humble obſervance, and faithful pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, attend the pleaſure of divine providence, and by a holy recumbency, acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in this aſſurance, that the evils that you ſee to day (when once the fatal period approacheth) <hi>you ſhall ſee them no more;</hi> as Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Could ye not watch with me one hour?</hi> ſo ſay I to you, Can ye not ſuffer one hour? one year, one age; he that is tyred, can crawl a little way further; Oh a little way further Chriſtian, one ſtep more for a Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is death at the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:174958:77"/>worſt but a night of Reſt? then this may animate, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and encourage all faint-hearted Chriſtians againſt the fear of dying. Will the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer grudge to go to bed when his days-work is done? Or will the Priſoner be affraid of that man, that ſhall knock off his fetters, open the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon door, and give him his inlargment? and ſhall the man of God dread death, which doth but come to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him out of a miſerable life? here thou art a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs; one day in pain, another day in diſgrace, one while diſtorted with Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, another while torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Gout or Collect, but almoſt continually calld upon to act the part of a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:174958:77"/>and why then are thou affraid of death which comes with an Acquittance in its hand, for thy diſcharge and delivery? It is I, ſaid our Saviour (when he ſaw a panick fear to riſe upon their ſpirits) and therefore be not affraid; ſo it is but death that comes in at thy Chamber door, that leaps up upon thy bed, that draws the Curtains and puts out the Candle of thy life, to let thee take thy reſt the better; It is but death I ſay, and therefore be not affraid; even ſuch a death which like <hi>Jacobs</hi> Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Is death at the worſt but a night of reſt? then this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:174958:78"/>may comfort us from mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immoderately for the death of dear Relations; Are they in reſt? why then ſhould you be reſtleſs and unquiet to, hear of their weal? death is thy friends gain, though thy loſs; &amp; canſt thou grieve &amp; ſorrow that he hath changed for the better; take heed, this will argue too much of ſelf-love, whilſt thou deeply lamenteſt thy loſs, but little rejoyceſt for thy friends gain; its his gain, I ſay again, unleſs it be no gain to be delivered out of a ſinfull ſickly body, yea a ſinful miſerable world, and carryed to a reſting place, where ſin and miſery never peept in; and this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alone, may miniſter matter of exceeding comfort, and incomparable quiet, to

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:174958:108"/>to declare what comforts I find and feel within me; I ſee and feel things that are unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, O I am raviſhed, I am raviſhed.</hi> O the Sea of delight that this ſanctified ſoul doth now ſwim in, doth it not raiſe your hearts, ſirs doth it not almoſt raviſh you, to ſee your friend thus ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed thus tranſported! was ever <hi>Paul</hi> in a more heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rapture! was ever <hi>Symeon</hi> more entranced with Divine joy, when he hugd his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in his armes! Oh we may ſpeak it when ſhe is gone, and preach it at her Funeral, that God dealt familiarly with her.</p>
            <p>Now the Devil envying her happineſs all this while, yet ſhaming to ſhew his black and griezly hue, whiles the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:174958:109"/>lightſome beams of Gods bleſſed countenance ſhone ſo powerfully upon her glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome heart, lay like a dog under the Table ſnarling and mallicing her fortunate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and no ſooner he perceived God to retreat and ſtep aſide a little, but he comes from behind the door, and began to tamper with her, and to tell her That all her peace ſhe pretended to, was no more then a truce, and her ſafety no better then a preſumptuous ſecurity; whereupon this ſtately Cedar began to ſtaggar, this accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht Chriſtian began to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion her title to heaven, and to diſpute her evidences: I am under a cloud, I am not right yet ſaid ſhe; I cannot but doubt yet whether my
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:174958:109"/>ſalvation be made ſure or no, and is not he or ſhe that doubteth damned?
